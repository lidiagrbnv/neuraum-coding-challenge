## Technologies used

For this particular task I used MVP approach: I chose to work on covering functionality, rather than doing everything the “correct” way, i.e. writing tests, setting up eslint, pre- and post-processors.

In this project I used React/Redux, immutable.js, Material UI.

I chose Redux because when you have global components that affect other components — it’s easier to maintain and handle app data when you have global store as single source of truth.

For prototyping I've chosen Material UI. I haven’t used it before but always wanted to try how fast I could build mockups using this component library. They have nice table implementation that's been particularly useful in this project.
